## 🌱 Currently Learning  

I recently built a **Nail Studio** project using **Django and React**, where I implemented **CRUD operations** and managed data efficiently between the frontend and backend – [check it out here!](https://f0cd3c7e-6ff3-490c-b642-a2b916772aa2.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapps.dev/).
