## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building modern, production-ready web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

On the frontend, I develop responsive and accessible user interfaces with React, focusing on component-based architecture, reusable logic, and clean state management using tools like Redux Toolkit. I pay attention to performance, usability, and creating intuitive user experiences.

On the backend, I design and build RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. I implement core features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and business logic, and connect applications to relational databases like PostgreSQL. I have experience designing database schemas and managing data efficiently.

I have built and deployed full-stack projects including an e-commerce platform and booking systems, where I handled both frontend and backend development, database integration, and deployment.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building scalable applications that solve real-world problems.
